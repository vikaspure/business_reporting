        some approach:

        A.Use GET /rest/api/3/worklog/updated to get the IDs of worklogs in the time period. The timestamp refers to the time the worklog has been created/updated, not the date to which the entry refers. To make sure I have everything, I just go later in the past. The call is paginated, and the response is small, so listing too much is not a big problem. You just need to remove the worklogs you don't want afterwards
        B.Use POST /rest/api/3/worklog/list to get the actual worklogs. The payload is the list of IDs to you got in the first step. This is limited to 1000 entries, but you can call it multiple times
        C.Bonus - If you need the issues for the retrieved worklogs, use POST /rest/api/3/search. You need to use POST, because the query will be very long and does not fit in the URL. You can build the query from the issue ids in the worklogs retrieved in step 2 (`id in (12345, 456789, ...)`

        some approach:

        A.Use GET /rest/api/3/worklog/updated to get the IDs of worklogs in the time period. The timestamp refers to the time the worklog has been created/updated, not the date to which the entry refers. To make sure I have everything, I just go later in the past. The call is paginated, and the response is small, so listing too much is not a big problem. You just need to remove the worklogs you don't want afterwards
        B.Use POST /rest/api/3/worklog/list to get the actual worklogs. The payload is the list of IDs to you got in the first step. This is limited to 1000 entries, but you can call it multiple times
        C.Bonus - If you need the issues for the retrieved worklogs, use POST /rest/api/3/search. You need to use POST, because the query will be very long and does not fit in the URL. You can build the query from the issue ids in the worklogs retrieved in step 2 (`id in (12345, 456789, ...)`
